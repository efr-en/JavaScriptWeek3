// Write a function that will allow you to calculate how many slices of 
// pizza x each person y would get if they shared evenly. The function should 
// return an interpolated string like Each person gets 4.00 slices of pizza; 
// from our 8-slice pizza x being a decimal in case there is no way to split 
// the pizza evenly.
